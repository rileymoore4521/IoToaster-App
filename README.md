# IoToaster-App
This is the IoToaster-App for group 12 at WSU. A standard use case for how this app would work is you can grab the release from the releases category or 
pull the repo release branch and build it on your own with the standard build settings.
From there you would open the app on the android device. This will refresh the presets and allow for adding/deleting/cooking. 
Device versions are supported from 4.0-11.0
